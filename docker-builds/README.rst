====================

This folder contains recipes to build docker images, these will also be
maintained at the Docker index site.

Images
------

Base: this is the basic test image that provides minimal IPython notebook and
shellinabox services.

Anaconda: similar to base, but provides the full set of Anaconda python
libraries, plus git and other goodies.
